# tensormodeltoraspi

This will be the area to work on a way for tensorflow models to be connected to raspiberry pi, to use the model for real time anaylsis. 

Basically it will use a model that was trained on MNIST in order to detect digits (0-9) in real time.

Parts needed;
MNIST Pretrained model (I have done this 99.8% acc)
Raspi zero (have)
Connection from model to raspi input (perhaps in python with tensorflow and opencv)
